This repository is the collection of the codes created for the University of Birmingham Particle Physics Group Studies.
In this project we looked at designing a model for a tracking detector using diodes on separate pixels.
Our code is separated into Geometric methods and into Monte Carlo methods that gave us different results when looking at optimising the tracking detector.
